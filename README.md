## 👋 Hi there, I'm Gaby. 

I’m a **Data Scientist** with expertise in **machine learning, NLP, multimodal models**, and **data analytics**. I specialize in building scalable ML models, optimizing data pipelines, and deploying models in production environments.

### 🔍 What I Do
* **Machine Learning & NLP** – Developing and fine-tuning models like **RoBERTa**, **CLIP**, and **T5** for classification, sentiment analysis, and text generation.  
* **Data Analysis & Processing** – Querying and analyzing data using **SQL** (Athena, Redshift), **Pandas**, and **PySpark**.  
* **Model Deployment & MLOps** – Working with **AWS SageMaker**, **CI/CD pipelines**, and **monitoring ML models** for performance optimization.  
* **Forecasting** – Using **N-BEATS** for multi-series forecasting to predict future trends across multiple time series.  
* **Visualization & Insights** – Building **Streamlit applications**, dashboards, and reports to communicate findings effectively.

### 📚 Projects  
Explore my [portfolio](https://gabya06.github.io/) to see projects covering:  
* **T5 & BART** text summarization models for automated summarization tasks.  
* **Sentiment analysis** on **Reddit** and **Glassdoor reviews** using NLP models.  
* **Data pull via PRAW API** for social media data collection.  
* **Streamlit app tutorial** for building interactive data visualizations.  
* **Classification models** for genre predictions based on text features.  
* **Ensemble methods** for price predictions using multiple machine learning models.

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
* **Languages**: Python, SQL  
* **ML Frameworks**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face  
* **Databases**: Amazon Redshift, AWS Athena, PostgreSQL  
* **Cloud & MLOps**: AWS SageMaker, Docker, CI/CD  
* **Visualization**: Streamlit, Tableau, Looker Studio

### ✨ Fun Facts
* 👩‍💻 When I'm not diving into data science, I teach seminars part-time, sharing knowledge and helping others grow in their careers.
* 🏋️‍♀️ I’m a **CrossFit enthusiast** - it's challenging but definitely fun! I enjoy pushing myself and seeing progress along the way! 
* 🐾 I’m also a proud pet parent to **two cats** who keep me on my toes (and provide plenty of cuddles 🐱).
